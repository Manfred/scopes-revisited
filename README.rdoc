= Scopes Revisited

Trying to find better ways to implement scopes in Active Record.

== Objectives

* Make scope stack merging more transparent (ie. not in a method with 5-level-deep nested if statements)
* Make scopes thread-safe
* Re-evaluate method and variable naming

== Ideas

* Merge scope stacks as late as possible to enable smarter merging
* Delegate and federate stack merging (ie. Scopes don't need to know how associations merge their query parameters)
